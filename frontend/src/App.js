The snippet from 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports \u2013 The White House' directly states that 'athletic associations have allowed men to compete in women's sports.' The SF.gov article gives historical examples, citing 'many examples over the last several decades of transwomen competing in sports,' and names Renee Richards, a trans woman who competed in women's tennis. However, some of the most recent policies, such as the NCAA policy described, are making such participation more restrictive. Overall, there is clear evidence that in some circumstances, men (including trans women) have been able to participate in women's sports.",
